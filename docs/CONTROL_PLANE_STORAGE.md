# Control-plane storage: budget, content stores, and reclaim

Status: operating contract for the production control plane (the single
Task Evaluation host). Measured 2026-09-02 on a 154 GB root disk at 98 %.

## Why the disk kept filling

Three structural causes, each now closed by code rather than by cleanup:

1. **Wrong content-addressing granularity.** The runtime-source wrapper embedded
   the invariant 4.29 GB runtime packet together with a per-release identity
   manifest and was stored by whole-file digest. Two same-size wrappers on the
   host differed only in `task_evaluation_adapter_bundle_manifest.v1.json`, so
   every deploy minted a new 4.29 GB blob (11 blobs, 47 GB).
2. **Immutable per-commit trees with no lifecycle.** Each deploy published a
   release worktree and two runtime trees per SHA and nothing retired them.
3. **No admission control.** Nothing on the host reserved space before a
   deploy, preparation, compile, or activation began; failure arrived as
   `ENOSPC` mid-write.

## Admission gate (`blueprint_pipeline.control_plane_disk_budget`)

Every write-heavy control-plane role reserves its footprint in a shared ledger
(`/var/lib/blueprint/pipeline-control-plane/disk-reservations`, `root:blueprint`
`2770`) before it mutates anything. Admission is
`free - floor - live reservations >= need`, where the floor is
`max(8 GiB, 5 % of the disk)` (`BLUEPRINT_CONTROL_PLANE_DISK_FLOOR_BYTES`).
A refusal is the typed blocker
`control_plane_disk_budget_exceeded:<role>:need_bytes=..:available_bytes=..:free_bytes=..:floor_bytes=..:reserved_bytes=..`
and never a host path.

| Role | Reserves | Where it refuses |
|---|---|---|
| `control_plane_deploy` | 2 GiB | `deploy_control_plane_commit.py` before provenance or staging |
| `launch_preparation` | exact bytes of references the content store lacks, plus 512 MiB; the runtime-source layer separately on a miss | preparation worker, before any fetch |
| `episode_compilation` | exact bytes of runtime members the member store lacks, plus 2 GiB | compile worker, before the output directory exists |
| `launch_activation` | 2 GiB | activation worker |
| `policy_canary_dispatch` | 2 GiB | canary dispatcher queue boundary |

The intake version endpoint reports `disk_headroom` with `refused_roles`; the
launch-preparation, launch-activation, and task-evaluation-launch intakes refuse
a submission (HTTP 503, typed blocker) while its role is refused.

Per-role defaults can be tuned with
`BLUEPRINT_CONTROL_PLANE_DISK_FOOTPRINT_<ROLE>_BYTES`.

## Runtime-source wrappers with external layers

`build_task_evaluation_runtime_source_bundle` accepts an external layer store.
Members at or above `--external-layer-min-bytes` (default 64 MiB) are written
once to `<store>/sha256/<digest>/<name>` and listed in the wrapper manifest as
`{"external_layer": {"transport": "content_addressed_external_layer.v1", "uri": ...}}`
instead of being archived. The wrapper stays a few kilobytes and keeps its
per-release identity bindings; the layer digest is stable across releases, so
the preparation content store holds one copy however many wrappers name it.

Build and publish (the URI prefix must be the artifact bucket and the
`native-runtime-source-layer` kind, because the publisher derives object keys
from content digests and the wrapper embeds the resulting URI verbatim):

```bash
python -m blueprint_pipeline.task_evaluation_native_arena_preparation_adapter build-runtime-source \
  --source-root <dir with native_task_runtime_sources.zip and its receipt> \
  --output <wrapper.zip> \
  --expected-production-commit <sha> --runtime-id native-arena --runtime-version isaac-2026-1 \
  --external-layer-store-root <local layer store> \
  --external-layer-uri-prefix s3://<artifact-bucket>/blueprint/arm-decision-proof-v1/configured-scenes/artifacts/native-runtime-source-layer \
  --receipt-out <build-receipt.json>
```

```bash
python -m blueprint_pipeline.task_evaluation_native_arena_preparation_adapter publish-runtime-source-layers \
  --receipt <build-receipt.json>
```

Then publish the wrapper itself exactly as before (`publish_configured_scene_artifact`,
kind `native-runtime-source`) and reference it from the Website request.

Consumers:

- **Preparation** materializes the wrapper, reads its manifest, and fetches every
  declared layer into `prepared-references/content-addressed/sha256/` once. The
  rows are recorded under
  `execution_adapter.runtime_source_bundle.external_layers.<n>` and flow to the
  compile envelope like every other verified reference. Preparation engages only
  for wrappers that declare external layers; such a wrapper that fails
  validation blocks with `launch_preparation_runtime_source_bundle_invalid:<reason>`
  before any fetch. Wrappers without declared layers keep their existing
  contract: the compile step validates them.
- **Compile** resolves each layer by digest through the adapter member store
  (`compiled-episodes/content-addressed/adapter-members/sha256/`): copied once on
  the first miss, hardlinked into every later compiled episode, verified against
  the manifest digest on every read. A missing or tampered layer is a typed
  refusal and the partial output is removed.
- **v1 wrappers** (embedded payload) keep working unchanged.

## Shared member and runtime stores

- Compiled episodes hardlink every verified adapter member from the member store
  instead of extracting a private copy.
- Splat-render runtime trees hardlink immutable prerequisite files (Node,
  Chromium, `node_modules`) from the prerequisite root; a per-commit tree costs
  directories and renderer sources only.

## Reclaim

`python -m blueprint_pipeline.control_plane_storage_gc --content-store-root <...>/prepared-references/content-addressed/sha256`
lists content-store blobs whose link count proves no preparation or compiled
episode still references them; `--apply --ack reap-unreferenced-content` removes
exactly the listed candidates after re-verifying each one. Evidence roots,
release worktrees, and runtime trees are never candidates for this tool.
